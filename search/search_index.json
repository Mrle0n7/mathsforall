Although my studying efficiency wasn't the highest, I had a general notion of immersion, as if my time is being used by me rather than just passing by. The Dutch sky is a canvas casually arranged by a mischievous child. Rainbows, dusk, pink evening glows, vast waves of clouds pushing forward are all masterpieces left by its casual hand.</p> <p>This week was also a chaotic week. Life felt like an unsolvable tangled mess. Just seeing its existence was annoying. Shuttling between exams, anxiety, sleep, and uncertain future, I once felt torn apart, unable to find a stable inner core.</p> <p>I really envy Vera. I envy her certainty, her stable core, her courage to express herself unreservedly, her openness and gentleness. I genuinely believe she is a gentle and firm person. How can one become gentle and firm?</p> <p>It wasn't until I left the dark room with no lights that I just moved in, and hid in the cloakroom to do math problems. It wasn't until I mustered the courage to voice my confusion in front of Shatavisa and saw the light in her eyes. Only then did I realize that in the world of mathematics, I am also that gentle and firm person.</p> <p>Perhaps gentleness is about facing difficult problems without avoiding or complaining, not scolding oneself for being slow, but accepting the fact that I \"don't know how yet.\" Perhaps firmness is about no matter how complex the problem is, focusing only on the very next step, believing that as long as I clarify the logic and keep moving, I will eventually arrive. Perhaps I do have a core. Perhaps my core is hidden within this process of carving out a space of tranquility for myself amidst chaos and uncertainty.</p> <p>So, gentleness and firmness are not two extremes, but a kind of inward strength. Not using strength to fight against oneself, because that is meaningless. Not wallowing in self-pity, because I need to learn to walk out of the prison I built with my own suffering, because there is no prison to begin with. I too can gradually grow into that gentle and firm self.</p>"},{"location":"reflection/wk2Nov/","title":"Weekly reflection Week 2 November","text":"<p>The previous reflection was posted somewhat late, which gives me a strange feeling when writing this one, \"Ah, how is it Monday again so soon?\" Time feels folded. In the week after exams, the expected relief did not descend. Instead, there was anxiety. I should be happy having time to update my website after exams, right? I should be happy living in the new house after exams, right? I should feel fulfilled studying and exercising with friends, right? Then why is anxiety still here?</p> <p>For DP1s, exams and clubs, SLI, YSE are like gears turning constantly. DP2s, predicted grades and personal statements hang like swords overhead. Everyone around carries a similar restlessness. We share a certain symptom of our times, weightless in the dizziness of freedom.</p> <p>Existentialism tells us that anxiety is the shadow of freedom. Anxiety comes because I realise my choices shape who I am, and I cannot escape this responsibility. Hesitation, procrastination, irritability are all essentially just shrinking back from the interrogations: \"Do I have other possibilities?\", \"What should I choose?\", \"Can I bear the consequences of this choice?\" Anxiety reminds us we are free, so we must make choices.</p> <p>In the context of Stoicism, anxiety stems from attachment to the future and to our self-image. We create a \"self we ought to be\" in our minds: excellent, recognised, mistake-free, in control... Constantly comparing this with our real selves, the disparity leads to anxiety. That phantom of eternal composure and excellence is always a light-year away from the clumsy reality.</p> <p>The most startling thing is that I have actually conspired with my anxiety. The truth is, though hard to admit, we enjoy the feeling of anxiety. We enjoy wrapping ourselves in an ideal bubble, indulging in fantasies during sleepless nights, without having to take any real action. Hiding in the cocoon of idealism planning millions of lives is clearly easier than actually making a single stroke on the paper. Wallowing in the quagmire of self-doubt is essentially no different from arrogance.</p> <p>Go on, try to observe anxiety, label it. Go pop the ideal bubble. Yes, you will fall from the sky, you will land bruised and battered, but isn't life precisely the sense of reality in that moment of falling? Yes, I've been anxious this week. Anxious about Chemistry and Physics exams, anxious about next week's tests and presentation, anxious about Duke of Ed, anxious about the future. But I also accomplished a lot. I kept updating my website. I tried volleyball for the first time. I helped move and assemble furniture. I dared to express my confusion and discuss it with teachers. Most importantly, I realized I was anxious, and I can stop it. When the ideal, self-set scenarios are overturned, when the truest face of life is revealed before us, we are finally able to touch this solid, rough horizon beneath our feet. Hello there~ Here, there's no preset script, but an unfinished poem.</p> <p>Try gently labeling the anxiety when it surges: \"Look, it's here again.\" Like observing the morning fog creeping over the window lattice, no longer rushing to dispel it. Only then do you discover that within the mist of anxiety lie the seeds of the future. It reminds me I'm still young, still eligible to make choices, still alive.</p> <p>Treat the unfinished as drafts, read uncertainty as possibility. In the new week, may we all pan for true gold in the river of anxiety.</p>"},{"location":"reflection/wk3Nov/","title":"Weekly reflection Week 3 November","text":"<p>After the study pressure throughout the week and the hike on Saturday, I woke up this morning sore all over. Under this dual endurance of body and mind, mathematics became my utopia for slowing down and finding myself again.</p> <p>Wandering through the fields of Maastricht, my thoughts drifted to another wilderness composed of formulas and theorems. The documentary about Fermat's Last Theorem I watched on a whim last night was like a stone thrown into the lake of my heart, its ripples still not settled.</p> <p>In the film, Andrew Wiles, in his attic study, held a solitary dialogue with a ghost spanning 358 years. On camera, he was silent, focused, his face interwoven with a faint smile and a kind of nearly sacred certainty. Seven years of self-confinement, merely to respond to a footnote in the notes of an ancient sage. In that moment, I seemed to witness the ultimate romance of human reason. One person, using the brilliance of lifetime, to light up a summit of light whose existence nobody even knew. I wonder, did he ever bitterly resent Fermat? When Fermat wrote that teasing note, \"I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this, which this margin is too narrow to contain,\" did Wiles, even for a single moment during those seven years, doubt what the meaning of mathematics was?</p> <p>I misunderstood my conversation with Vera that day. What I heard then was, \"What's the use of learning math?\" and instinctively turned into defensive mode, starting to strategize in my head. It wasn't until we talked about it again later that I truly understood her meaning. She said, \"For me, everything has meaning\u2026 I don't like using 'usefulness' to measure the value of something. Its meaning depends on whether one can gain something from it, on how I give it meaning.\" In that moment, all my previous defenses seemed clumsy and futile. I was speechless, didn't know how to respond, my thoughts couldn't form coherent sentences, just chaotic permutations and combinations. Her question was never a challenge, but a key, inviting me to open my inner world to find the answer. Breaking out of the cage of \"usefulness,\" what does mathematics truly mean to me? Carrying her question, I re-entered my life this week, and only then became sure of an answer.</p> <p>Unlike many, I don't enjoy discussing the applications of mathematics, not because I flaunt some lofty purity. \"The sixpence were everywhere, but he looked up and saw the moon.\" I don't really like this saying, as it implies that the so-called \"sixpence\" are petty gains, while chasing the moon is full of romanticism. All choices should hold equal value and importance. It's just that in my heart, the mathematics I've chosen, especially that \"pure mathematics\" existing in the writings of Fermat and Wiles, is neither the moon nor the sixpence. It's more like the starry sky itself.</p> <p>We look up at the starry sky, not because it can guide us home (although navigation indeed originated from it), but because it possesses a breathtaking beauty in itself, because it tells us our place in the universe. Learning mathematics is learning how to gaze upon this starry sky of logic and imagination. Yes, it doesn't directly give you bread and milk, but it offers a perspective that soars beyond all limits.</p> <p>However, the longer I wander under this starry sky, a subtle unease grows clearer. I often feel a sense of guilt. A significant part of my reason for learning mathematics is to satisfy, as my math teacher Shatavisa said, my own so-called \"intellectual satisfaction.\" Another part is a yearning for the beauty of the entire mathematical world. I am timid about admitting this passion to others. A voice always exists: Is spending so much intelligence, time, and social resources on a subject with no immediate use for real life (at least in the short term) a luxurious waste? Is it too selfish to occupy public resources for the intellectual satisfaction of a few? This lingering shadow looms over the starlight.</p> <p>This week I worked through a proof of the Basel Problem \u2013 a problem with no practical use, yet holding significant position in analysis and number theory. Who would have thought that the classical mathematical study of infinite series, in the hands of Euler and Riemann, would be so closely linked to prime numbers? That afternoon, sunlight slanted across my computer screen. Finally, after numerous mistakes, the moment I solved that double integral, that clear, unadulterated joy rose from the depths of my heart once again.</p> <p>I used to think that history shows us: if no one was obsessed with gazing at the stars, there would be no later ocean voyages or globalization. Similarly, if no one was intoxicated with pure mathematical logic, there would be no computers or the digital age today. The \"satisfaction\" that Wiles and others \"selfishly\" burned their lives for had the by-product of a blazing fire illuminating humanity's future path. They were drawing maps for all possible worlds in advance, and we, eventually, at some point, become the beneficiaries of these maps.</p> <p>It was in that moment I realized: I always claimed \"what's important is not finding an answer, but immersing oneself in the pure and painful process of inquiry itself,\" yet regarding mathematics, I had been using the wrong scale to measure value. I tried to use the ruler of \"usefulness\" to measure \"existence,\" the scale of \"results\" to weigh the \"process.\"</p> <p>The use of mathematics for me lies not in what it might build in the future, but in what kind of \"me\" it shapes. It is my practice against the nihilism of life and the restlessness of the world. In the labyrinth of symbols, I learn patience, rigour, and honesty; in the chains of logic, I experience the solace brought by certainty and pure beauty. This \"satisfaction\" is not selfish pleasure, but the tranquility brought back to the human world after wandering under the starry sky.</p> <p>This week, this lifetime, I have not, and perhaps never will, prove any unsolved problem. My scratch paper will ultimately end up in the bin. But I know something has been permanently collected. It is a reconciliation with this inner sense of guilt. I have accepted this seemingly \"useless\" love. I no longer need to find any high-sounding defense for it.</p> <p>The value of mathematics lies in the fact that it lit me up. I know I am not the first, and I certainly will not be the last. Lives lit up, one by one, become points of light themselves. Protecting this starry sky means protecting this ability to be moved by pure beauty, preventing it from being extinguished by short-term utility, letting it shine brilliantly through civilizations.</p>"},{"location":"reflection/wk4Oct/","title":"Weekly reflection Week 4 October","text":"<p>I can\u2019t believe there's only one week left for October. For DP2s, this brings the end of REAs, EDs, EAs, while for us DP1s, it means facing a pile-up of exams and exams, and more exams. Everyone is so busy, so busy that no one seems to have noticed that autumn is about to leave Maastricht.</p> <p>\"Seize the tail end of autumn.\" That's what I wanted to do. This week, I started maintaining a routine of moderate-intensity running. My 3-kilometer run on Friday was quite fast. Now, the feeling of steady breathing and strong strides during a 5-kilometer run is deeply satisfying. I also discovered that my persistence seems to have (more or less) motivated those around me. They've started being willing to try it out too.</p> <p>There had also had warm little moments during the week. My mom tried chestnut chicken for the first time, which was incredibly fragrant, and the wonton noodles from Oodles of Noodles were also satisfying. Eat well. Truly experience the present. Feel the warmth of life.</p> <p>Something Vera mentioned this week made me ponder. \"Every rising thought and stirring intention is a cause; and everything experienced in the present is an effect.\" She meant that if my current situation and feelings are the results of past thoughts, then everything I'm thinking now is quietly determining my future. This idea made me pause and re-examine the meaning of \"the present moment\".</p> <p>My first reaction was confusion. I believe the nature of things does not change according to my personal will, just like mathematical theorems won't differ based on my desires. But upon more thinking, these two ideas aren't contradictory as they seem to be. The world operates according to inherent laws that exist independently of individual will. Our \"rising thoughts and stirring intentions\" themselves are also the result of brain activity and environmental influences \u2013 objective factors. The essential laws of things exist objectively, but it is precisely these objective laws that determine how \"thoughts and intentions\" become the cause of \"present experiences.\" It's not passive fatalism, nor blind idealism of consciousness. Instead, it's about respecting the immutability of objective laws while skillfully using subjective initiative to create positive changes within the framework of these laws.</p> <p>We often think of the future being distant and unknowable. But if the future is built bit by bit from the beliefs, attitudes, and actions of the present, then every decision I make now, every thought, even every tiny emotion, is sowing the seeds of future \"effects.\" Perhaps this means I have already, to some extent, \"grasped\" the future. Not through prophecy, but through belief. Believing in this moment, living attentively. That is the most profound prophecy. The future was never a result waiting to be unveiled, but a process continuously unfolding right now.</p> <p>Thinking of this, I suddenly feel reassured: I don't need to rush to know what will happen. I only need to live consciously in every single 'now'.</p> <p>\"Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.\" (Proverbs 4:23, NIV)</p>"},{"location":"writing/sonder/","title":"The Mask We Choose","text":"<p>When I signed up for Makeup Atelier as my Creativity this year, I knew I was an anomaly. And when friends talk about CAS, the most common reaction I received was a uniform shock. \u201cYou? Why?\u201d, as if the idea of a boy - the only boy - signing up to learn how to apply makeups for other people, when there are so many other options suggesting more masculine aspects, is so absurd and shocking. Even the DP2 organiser, though kind, was visibly surprised when I signed up, committed to a promise she had assumed was a joke.</p> <p>Right. I admit. It is a bit weird. But have you even thought of, of why this idea appears weirdly in everyone's minds? It was as if I had broken some unspoken rule about what a person like me should be interested in.</p> <p>Before I started, I, too, held a simplistic view. I couldn't understand why people use weird instruments, that all looked as if they're designed for torturing, to put some powders and paint onto their faces - I mean, you do realise that it's your own face when you pinch a brush into your eyes, right? But it was more than that. I believed in the binary of \u201cnatural\u201d versus \u201cartificial,\u201d where \u201cnatural\u201d was synonymous with \u201cauthentic\u201d and \u201cgood,\u201d and \u201cartificial\u201d was synonymous with \u201cdeceptive\u201d and \u201cbad.\u201d We are taught that masks, whether regarding outward appearance or deeper personalities, are for hiding, that the truest self is the one that wakes up in the morning, unadorned and unedited. I, therefore, had always held a quiet distance from peers who dedicated time to it. It was all unnecessary and a waste of time. </p> <p>But here I am, in front of the mirror, observing a girl\u2019s hands. They trembled slightly as she tried to line her eyes. Frustrated, she claimed to give up, but her hands didn't stop practicing. When she finally succeeded, her whole posture changed. The girl who walked in looking tired and small now stood a little taller, her gaze steady and defined. </p> <p>Perhaps I was motivated, I had a try. It was only when I first saw myself in the mirror with the contrast of half of my face covered with makeup and half original, that I realised we are all, constantly and inevitably, presenting an edited version of ourselves. And I'm not only talking about makeup. The quiet student wears a mask of introspection, which might hide a roaring inner world. The class clown wears a mask of invulnerability, which might has a tender heart. I questioned myself: we call these \u201cpersonalities\u201d or \u201csocial skills,\u201d and I rarely accuse them of being \u201cfake.\u201d So why is the mask of makeup treated with such suspicion? </p> <p>In the atelier, I learned that the face paint is just another layer of that universal human editing. It\u2019s not about creating a false front. It\u2019s about choosing which truth to lead with.</p> <p>The bold red lipstick isn't a lie; it\u2019s a signal for a day of courage. The careful concealer isn't a deception; it\u2019s a quiet request: \u201cSee my work, not my fatigue.\u201d The shimmer on a lid is a glimpse of an inner light the wearer wants to amplify.</p> <p>Just as a writer chooses which words to convey feelings, they should, and ought to choose which features to highlight, what mood to project. The gentle shimmer on her eyelids was a hint of the optimism she wanted everyone to feel. The precise eyeliner can imply clarity in her thoughts. We are all curators of our own complex narratives. Admit it. Our time and attention is limited; we cannot possibly unpack the full, messy, glorious story of every single person we meet. So we rely on these curated first impressions, these \u201cmasks\u201d, as a necessary social shorthand. Makeup, then, is a way of making that first impression a generous one. </p> <p>I may not put on these faces myself, but I have learned to read them. I see now that the most \u201cauthentic\u201d self isn't just the one that rolls out of bed. It\u2019s also the self we have the courage to intentionally build each morning, the self we choose to offer to the world.</p> <p>We are all multifaceted. We contain shadows and light, confidence and doubt, chaos and order. To claim that only the \u201cnatural\u201d face is the \u201creal\u201d one is to deny the complexity of the human spirit.
