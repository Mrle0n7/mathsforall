The graph of a function \\(f(x)\\) is given, and we were asked to graph \\(xf(x)\\). For the original function \\(f(x)\\), there exists a horizontal asymptote of \\(y=2\\). I wonder if this asymptote turns to an oblique asymptote \\(y=2x\\) after the transformation.</p> <p>Please find attached my current thoughts: Download the document(PDF)</p> <p>My further investigation may include fitting the points to find an algebraic expression for \\(f(x)\\), even a rough one is sufficient, and test if it has an oblique asymptote.</p>"},{"location":"notes/The_function_with_no_graph/","title":"Discovery of power-exponential functions","text":"<p>The inspiration comes from a question I found online. When I first attempted to graph the function using some plotting tools, the same error occurred.</p> <p>Please find attached my current investigations: Download the document(PDF)</p> <p>Spoiler: Notice that the graph becomes quadratic when changing the 1 to 2, and cubic when 3. What might happen then?</p>"},{"location":"notes/Why_Dot_Product/","title":"The nature of dot product","text":"<p>I had the most random idea when doing vectors. Consider the definition of dot product. I understand the geometric interpretation of dot product, but algebraically?</p> <p>We all agree on the statement \\(\\| v \\|^2 = v \\cdot v\\). But why? Why is it the dot product? What is the significance of its algebraic expression?</p> <p>Download the document(PDF)</p>"},{"location":"projects/Optimization/","title":"Modification of existing numerical optimization methods in the application of logistic regression","text":"<p>Numerical optimization methods are wildly used in regression models in finding the coefficients, as it fits well with matrices and therefore can handle cases for large number of variables. In addition to that, the iterative nature of numerical optimization allows computations to weave in. However, there exists limitations for each and every single optimization method. In logistic regression, is there a way of coming up with a new method, that makes the iterative process more efficient?</p> <p>Click to download the document explaining the background: Download the document (PDF)</p> <p>My attempts:</p> <p>The Newton Optimization Method relies on the quadratic approximation revealed by Taylor Expansion.
