The graph of a function f(x) is given, and we were asked to graph xf(x). For the original function f(x), there exists a horizontal asymptote of y=2. I wonder if this asymptote turns to an oblique asymptote y=2x after the transformation.</p> <p>Please find attached my current thoughts: Download the document(PDF)</p> <p>My further investigation may include fitting the points to find an algebraic expression for f(x), even a rough one is sufficient, and test if it has an oblique asymptote.</p>"}]}
