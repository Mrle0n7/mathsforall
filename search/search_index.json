Why is the dot product of vectors defined that way?

The graph of a function f(x) is given, and we were asked to graph xf(x). For the original function f(x), there exists a horizontal asymptote of y=2. I wonder if this asymptote turns to an oblique asymptote y=2x after the transformation.</p> <p>Please find attached my current thoughts: Download the document(PDF)</p> <p>My further investigation may include fitting the points to find an algebraic expression for f(x), even a rough one is sufficient, and test if it has an oblique asymptote.</p>"},{"location":"notes/The_function_with_no_graph/","title":"Discovery of power-exponential functions","text":"<p>The inspiration comes from a question I found online. When I first attempted to graph the function using some plotting tools, the same error occurred.</p> <p>Please find attached my current investigations: Download the document(PDF)</p> <p>Spoiler: Notice that the graph becomes quadratic when changing the 1 to 2, and cubic when 3. What might happen then?</p>"}]}
