## Multivariable Differential Calculus

- [The nature of dot product](notes/Why_Dot_Product.md)

- [Proof of universal equation of curvature with parameter t](notes/Curvature_time_parametrization_proof.md)

## Algebraic Topology

- [Proof of definition of open set in metric space](notes/proof_open_interior.md)

- [Proof of definition of closed set in metric space](notes/proof_closed_interior.md)

## Project

# About
Mathsforall is a garage for my investigations within the field of mathematics (perhaps will explore more in other fields!). The documents are free for all, which means that anyone can use any information available in this website without any consent! I aim to write in a clear and precise manner, that means it might not be rigorous at all times, but I hope everyone finds it easy to understand. If you wish to receive the .tex files please contact me! If you seek any clarification in any of the documents please contact me! If you're just bored and have nobody to talk to please contact me!
