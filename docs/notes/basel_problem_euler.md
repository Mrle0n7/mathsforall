# Proof of Basel Problem by Leonhard Euler

The Basel Problem was first introduced in 1644 by an Italian mathematician Pietro Mengoli. The problem remained open for 90 years, until Leonhard Euler gave his first proof in 1734.

The Basel Problem has great significance as it is a special case of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ when $s = 2$. The Basel Problem examines $\zeta(2)$ to be equal to $\frac{\pi^2}{6}$.

The Basel Problem asks for the sum of the series:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = 1 + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{4^2} + ...
\]

Mengoli calculated the sum of the first 1000 terms by himself, giving the results as follows:

\[
1 + \frac{1}{2^2} + ... + \frac{1}{998^2} = 1.643932...
\]

\[
1 + \frac{1}{2^2} + ... + \frac{1}{998^2} + \frac{1}{999^2} = 1.643933... 
\]

\[
1 + \frac{1}{2^2} + ... + \frac{1}{998^2} + \frac{1}{999^2} + \frac{1}{1000^2} = 1.643934...
\]

He then proposed that the series is converging to 1.644934, yet not sure about any inaccuracies. Euler, when he first saw that number, immediately identified the value to be equivilant to $\frac{\pi^2}{6}$. The tale is now impossible to verify, what we are certain is that Euler gave the first ever proof for the Basel Problem. [Download the document(PDF)](../assets/Basil_problem.pdf)
