# Proof of definition of open set in metric space

Open and closed sets; interior, exterior and boundary points; ... These are basic yet essential concepts in algebraic topology, which shaped and defined the spaces. For the conscientiousness of mathematics, this document, as part of a series, explores the definitions, and see how these definitions work together to produce theorems.

The proof for the theorem

A set $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$ is open if and only if every point on $D$ is an interior point.
