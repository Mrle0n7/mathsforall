# Determining the oblique asymptote solely on the graph

The inspiration comes from a question given in class. The graph of a function $f(x)$ is given, and we were asked to graph $xf(x)$. For the original function $f(x)$, there exists a horizontal asymptote of $y=2$. I wonder if this asymptote turns to an oblique asymptote $y=2x$ after the transformation.

Please find attached my current thoughts:

My further investigation may include fitting the points to find an algebraic expression for $f(x)$, even a rough one is sufficient, and test if it has an oblique asymptote.
